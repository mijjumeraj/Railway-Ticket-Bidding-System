üöÇ Railway Ticket Bidding System (Django & ML-Powered)
‚ú® Project Overview
This project is an innovative, web-based platform designed to optimize the redistribution of canceled railway tickets. When a ticket is canceled, the system allows travelers to bid on the available seat, thereby minimizing the number of empty seats and maximizing railway revenue.

üß† ML Integration (Bid Prediction Service)
The system utilizes a Machine Learning (ML) service to estimate the maximum acceptable bid amount (Max Bid Amount) based on ticket characteristics (such as destination, travel date, and class). This ensures that the bidding process remains transparent and fair, and prevents excessive overbidding.

üöÄ Key Features
Ticket Listing: Real-time list of all canceled tickets available for bidding.

Bidding Mechanism: Users can place bids on a ticket within the calculated maximum bid limit.

Bid Validation: The bid amount must be greater than the Base Price and less than the ML-determined Max Bid.

Bid Updates: Users can update their current bid at any time.

Highest Bid Tracking: The current highest bid for each ticket is prominently displayed.
