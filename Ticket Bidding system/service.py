    Predicts the maximum expected bid amount for a given canceled ticket.
    
    In a real-world scenario, this function would load a trained ML model 
    (e.g., a Regression Model) and use ticket features (origin, destination, 
    travel_date, etc.) to predict demand and determine the max bid.

    Args:
        ticket_instance (Ticket): The Ticket object being created.

    Returns:
        Decimal: The predicted maximum bid price.
